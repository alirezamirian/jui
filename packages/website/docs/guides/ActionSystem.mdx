# Actions

:::warning Experimental
The current implementation of the action system is experimental and is likely to undergo significant revisions to meet
the performance demands of real-world applications with thousands of actions.
:::

An _action_ represents an available functionality, without specifying how it's invoked. Shortcuts can separately be
assigned to actions via a `keymap`, allowing for a customizable and personalized user experience. The action system,
at its core, is only about defining actions for each part of the UI and associating these actions with
shortcuts, without any direct dependencies on other aspects of the design system. However, there are
[UI components](#ui-components) available to facilitate creation of toolbars and menus based on actions.

:::note
The core functionality of the action system may be extracted into a standalone package in the future,
making it a reusable component for applications built using any design system.
:::

The action system consists of the following primary components:

- `ActionsProvider` component, which allows for defining actions for a UI area.
- `KeymapProvider` component, which allows for assigning shortcut(s) to actions.
- UI components that helps with creating menus, toolbars, etc. based on action system abstractions.

Below is a basic example of how these components are used.
Subsequent sections will provide detailed explanations of the components and interfaces involved.

```tsx live noInline noPadding themed
const StyledDiv = styled.div`
  &:focus {
    outline: 4px solid ${({ theme }) => theme.color("Button.focusedBorderColor")}!important;
    outline-offset: 2px;
  }
`;
render(
  <KeymapProvider
    keymap={{
      MY_ACTION: [
        {
          type: "keyboard",
          firstKeyStroke: { modifiers: ["Shift"], code: "KeyD" },
        },
      ],
    }}
  >
    <ActionsProvider
      actions={[
        {
          id: "MY_ACTION",
          title: "My Action",
          icon: <PlatformIcon icon="general/information.svg" />,
          actionPerformed: () => alert("My Action performed"),
        },
      ]}
    >
      {({ shortcutHandlerProps }) => (
        <div {...shortcutHandlerProps} style={{ padding: "1rem" }}>
          <StyledDiv tabIndex={0}>
            Click here to focus, then press <code>Shift+D</code>
          </StyledDiv>
          <br />
          <div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "center", gap: "0.5rem" }}>
            Or press this button: <ActionButton actionId="MY_ACTION" />
          </div>
        </div>
      )}
    </ActionsProvider>
  </KeymapProvider>
);
```

## Defining actions

`ActionsProvider` is used as a wrapper component that defines available actions for the wrapped UI.
Multiple, potentially nested `ActionsProvider` may be rendered in an application. `ActionProvider` itself doesn't render
any wrapper element. Shortcut event handler props are passed to `children` which is expected to be a render function:

```tsx
<ActionsProvider actions={actions}>
  {({ shortcutHandlerProps }) => <div {...shortcutHandlerProps}>...</div>}
</ActionsProvider>
```

`actions` is an array of objects implementing `ActionDefinition` interface. At minimum, an action must have:

- `id`: A unique identifier based on which shortcuts are assigned in `keymap`.
- `actionPerformed`: A function to be invoked when the action is triggered, e.g. via a shortcut.
- `title`: The only mandatory presentation information for the action.

Moreover, an action has the following optional properties:

- `isDisabled`: If `true`, prevents action from being performed. [Action UI components](#ui-components) will also utilize
  this field to either disable or hide the corresponding UI component.
- `icon`: A React node to be used as the associated icon for the action. It's required if the action is to be rendered
  as an [ActionButton](#actionbutton), and optional for [menu items](#menu).
- `description`: Plain text, additional description about the action. Not used in [ActionButton](#actionbutton), or
  [menu items](#menu).

### Action Groups

An ActionGroup is a special type of action with a list of children actions. An action group itself can be performed.

### Default action group

A default implementation of action group is available, which when performed, opens a [Popup](../components/Popup),
presenting the children actions in a [SpeedSearchMenu](../components/Menu#speedsearchmenu). The default action
group requires [PopupManager](../components/Popup#popupmanager), for opening the popup.

`useCreateDefaultActionGroup` returns a function that creates action groups:

```tsx
import { useCreateDefaultActionGroup } from "@intellij-platform/core";

const createDefaultActionGroup = useCreateDefaultActionGroup();

createDefaultActionGroup({
  id: "MY_ACTION_GROUP",
  title: "My Action Group",
  children: [
    /* action definitions */
  ],
});
```

```tsx themed live noInline
function ExampleApp({ children }) {
  return (
    <PopupManager>
      <KeymapProvider
        keymap={{
          Changelists: [
            {
              type: "keyboard",
              firstKeyStroke: { modifiers: ["Shift"], code: "KeyD" },
            },
          ],
        }}
      >
        {children}
      </KeymapProvider>
    </PopupManager>
  );
}
function DefaultActionGroupExample() {
  const createDefaultActionGroup = useCreateDefaultActionGroup();

  return (
    <ActionsProvider
      actions={[
        createDefaultActionGroup({
          id: "Changelists",
          title: "Changelists",
          icon: <PlatformIcon icon="vcs/changelist.svg" />,
          children: [
            {
              id: "New Changelist...",
              title: "New Changelist...",
              icon: <PlatformIcon icon="general/add.svg" />,
              actionPerformed: () => alert("New Changelist..."),
            },
            {
              id: "Edit Changelist...",
              title: "Edit Changelist...",
              icon: <PlatformIcon icon="actions/edit.svg" />,
              actionPerformed: () => alert("Edit Changelist..."),
            },
            {
              id: "Move to another changelist...",
              title: "Move to another changelist...",
              actionPerformed: () => alert("Edit Changelist..."),
            },
          ],
        }),
      ]}
    >
      {({ shortcutHandlerProps }) => (
        <div {...shortcutHandlerProps}>
          <ActionButton actionId="Changelists" />
        </div>
      )}
    </ActionsProvider>
  );
}

render(
  <ExampleApp>
    <DefaultActionGroupExample />
  </ExampleApp>
);
```

## Using actions

`useActions` can be used to query the list of all provided actions. Use `useAction` instead to query an specific action,
by id. The queried `Action` object has a `perform` method which can be invoked e.g. when a menu item or a button is
pressed. Note that `Action` interface is quite similar but not identical to `ActionDefinition`.

```tsx
function MyActionButton() {
  const action = useAction("MY_ACTION");
  return action && <Button onPress={() => action.perform()}>My Action</Button>;
}
```

`useActionGroup` is also similar to `useAction`, but it asserts the queried action is a group.

### Query actions based on DOM elements

`useAction` or `useActions` is the canonical API for accessing currently provided actions from a React component.
`getAvailableActionsFor` is an alternative API that allows for querying available actions from a DOM element. This can
be useful in specific scenarios such as the implementation of the [find action][find-action-in-the-reference-impl].
You can also check out the implementation of "find action" action [in the example app][find-action-in-example-app].

### UI components

`useAction`, and `useActionGroup` can be used to query actions and create a menu or toolbar out of them. For typical
use cases, however, there are convenient components that interface on `Action` or action id.

### Menu

Use `ActionsMenu` to render a list of action objects as a menu. `ActionGroup` items are rendered as a section or a
submenu, depending on `menuPresentation` property of the action group object.
Note that `ActionsMenu` just provides an interface based on action items, but it doesn't query any action from the
actions context, and just uses action properties to create menu items from it.

```tsx themed live
<ActionsMenu
  // actions would normally be coming from useAction calls, rather than hard coded like this, but this example
  // shows how ActionsMenu is a dump component mapping Action objects to menu items.
  actions={[
    {
      id: "Cut",
      title: "Cut",
      icon: <PlatformIcon icon="actions/menu-cut.svg" />,
      shortcut: "⌘X",
      perform: () => alert("Cut"),
    },
    {
      id: "Copy",
      title: "Copy",
      icon: <PlatformIcon icon="actions/copy.svg" />,
      shortcut: "⌘C",
      perform: () => alert("Copy"),
    },
    {
      id: "Copy Path/Reference...",
      title: "Copy Path/Reference...",
      perform: () => alert("Copy Path/Reference..."),
    },
    {
      id: "Paste",
      title: "Paste",
      icon: <PlatformIcon icon="actions/menu-paste.svg" />,
      shortcut: "⌘V",
      perform: () => alert("Paste"),
    },
    new DividerItem(),
    {
      id: "Compare with...",
      title: "Diff",
      icon: <PlatformIcon icon="actions/diff.svg" />,
      shortcut: "⌘D",
      perform: () => alert("Diff"),
    },
  ]}
/>
```

Use `ActionGroupMenu` to render actions of an action group, as a menu:

```tsx themed live
<ActionGroupMenu
  // actions would normally be coming from useAction calls, rather than hard coded like this, but this example
  // shows how ActionsMenu is a dump component mapping Action objects to menu items.
  actionGroup={{
    id: "FILE_ACTIONS",
    title: "File Actions",
    children: [
      {
        id: "Cut",
        title: "Cut",
        icon: <PlatformIcon icon="actions/menu-cut.svg" />,
        shortcut: "⌘X",
        perform: () => alert("Cut"),
      },
      {
        id: "Copy",
        title: "Copy",
        icon: <PlatformIcon icon="actions/copy.svg" />,
        shortcut: "⌘C",
        perform: () => alert("Copy"),
      },
      {
        id: "Copy Path/Reference...",
        title: "Copy Path/Reference...",
        perform: () => alert("Copy Path/Reference..."),
      },
      {
        id: "Paste",
        title: "Paste",
        icon: <PlatformIcon icon="actions/menu-paste.svg" />,
        shortcut: "⌘V",
        perform: () => alert("Paste"),
      },
      {
        id: "DIFF_ACTION_GROUP",
        title: "Diff actions",
        children: [
          {
            id: "Compare with...",
            title: "Diff",
            icon: <PlatformIcon icon="actions/diff.svg" />,
            shortcut: "⌘D",
            perform: () => alert("Diff"),
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  }}
/>
```

### ActionButton

Use `ActionButton` to create an `IconButton` based on a provided action. Unlike `ActionsMenu` and `ActionGroupMenu`,
`ActionButton` interfaces on action ID, and queries the target action via `useAction`. If the action doesn't exist,
it renders nothing.

```jsx live themed noPadding
<ActionsProvider
  actions={[
    {
      id: "refresh",
      title: "Refresh",
      icon: <PlatformIcon icon="actions/refresh.svg" />,
      actionPerformed: () => alert("Refresh"),
    },
  ]}
>
  {({ shortcutHandlerProps }) => (
    <div {...shortcutHandlerProps} style={{ padding: "1rem" }}>
      <ActionButton actionId="refresh" />
    </div>
  )}
</ActionsProvider>
```

## Shortcuts and key mapping

A `Keymap` is a mapping from action ids to a list of associated shortcuts. In an application that uses actions, the
`KeymapProvider` is typically used as a top level wrapper, to provide a keymap.

```tsx
import {Keymap, KeymapProvider} from '@intellij-platform/core';

const keymap: Keymap = isMac() ? macKeymap : defaultKeymap;
<KeymapProvider keymap={keymap}>...</KeyMapProvider>
```

## Differences with the Intellij Platform

While the action system almost replicates [Intellij Platform's Action System][action-system], there are some design
differences worth noting:
