# Button

Standalone [Button](https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/controls/button/) with a textual label.

### Features

- Support for `default` button UI
- Focus management options (`preventFocusOnPress`, `excludeFromTabOrder`)

#### Remaining

- [ ] [Default button behaviour](https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/controls/button/#default) is not implemented yet. It's
      just the appearance at the moment.
- [ ] Platform Specific UI. It's based on Mac UI at the moment.
- [ ] Support for mnemonics.

```jsx live themed
<>
  <Button>Button</Button> <br />
  <br />
  <Button variant="default">Default</Button> <br />
  <br />
  <Button variant="icon">?</Button> <br />
  <br />
  <Button isDisabled>Disabled</Button> <br />
  <br />
  <Button excludeFromTabOrder>Exclude from tab order</Button> <br />
  <br />
  <Button preventFocusOnPress>Prevent focus on press</Button> <br />
  <br />
</>
```

:::caution Accessibility Caveat
Following the original implementation, there is currently no visual feedback for pressed (active) state. That's more of
an issue when `preventFocusOnPress` is used.
:::

:::info focus visibility
Following the original implementation, the focus ring is visible even when the interaction is done by mouse.
It's more common to show focus ring only when interacted with keyboard, but focus being always visible
mitigates accessibility issue above.
