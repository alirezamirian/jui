# Balloon

Support for [Balloon notification](https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/controls/balloon/) is divided into two parts.
Components for decoratively rendering a Balloon, and an API for showing balloon notifications imperatively (e.g. in
response to events).

#### Remaining features

- [ ] `BalloonActions` component for rendering actions links where
      [non-fitting ones are moved into a dropdown](https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/controls/balloon/#19).

- [ ] Support for error style notification (used for IDE errors) <img
      src={imgSrc}
      width="200"
      style={{ verticalAlign: "middle", margin: "0 10px" }}
      />

## Declarative API

Components used for rendering a [Balloon notification](https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/controls/balloon/):

### Balloon

Renders a single [Balloon notification](https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/controls/balloon/). Different parts of the
balloon are passed as props. Timeout for hiding the balloon is not supported at this level. See
[useBalloons](#useBalloons) for that.

### BalloonActionLink

A tiny wrapper around [Link](./Link) component, to be used for actions in Balloon. It closes the balloon when pressed.

:::info Note
How balloon notifications are stacked and positioned in bottom right, and an imperative API for triggering notifications
is outside the scope of what this component is about. Use [BalloonProvider](#balloonprovider) and
[useBalloons](#useballoons) for that.

### Live example

```jsx live themed
<>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <Balloon
    // try "Error", "Warning", or a custom icon: <PlatformIcon icon="expui/fileTypes/docker.svg" />
    icon={"Info"}
    // try changing title to something too long
    title="Maven Projects need to be imported"
    // depending on how big body is, it may becomes expandable
    body="Projects to be imported: MavenSync, MavenDependencies. Maven project structure has been changed. Import changes to IntelliJ IDEA project to make it work correctly."
    actions={
      <>
        <BalloonActionLink>Import changes</BalloonActionLink>
        <BalloonActionLink>Enable auto-import</BalloonActionLink>
      </>
    }
    // close button is shown only if onClose is passed
    onClose={console.log}
    // header actions are placed next to the close button in the header
    headerActions={
      <AutoHoverPlatformIcon icon="ide/notification/gear" role="button" />
    }
   />
</>
```

### Expandable body

Body becomes expandable only if the content doesn't fit within the allowed number of lines. The expanded state can
[optionally be controlled](https://medium.com/quick-code/writing-ui-components-with-optionally-controllable-state-86e396a6f1ec).

```jsx live themed
<>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <Balloon
    body="Projects to be imported: MavenSync, MavenDependencies. Maven project structure has been changed. Import changes to IntelliJ IDEA project to make it work correctly."
    //     expanded
   />
</>
```

## Imperative API

### BalloonProvider

`BalloonProvider` renders the necessary context for using [useBalloons](#useballoons), as well as the stack of the
notifications. By default it renders the notifications stack as a portal appended to body. This can be disabled by
setting `disablePortal` to `true`. Either way, the notifications stack is an overlay placed at the bottom right of
where it's rendered. If portal is disabled, position will be `absolute`, otherwise `fixed`.

### useBalloons

`useBalloons` gives access to the imperative API for showing balloon notifications.

```jsx
const { show, showSticky } = useBalloons();
```

```jsx live noInline themed
const App = () => (
  <BalloonsProvider>
    <SomeComponent />
  </BalloonsProvider>
);
const SomeComponent = () => {
  const { show } = useBalloons();
  const showNotification = () => {
    show({
      title: "Maven projects need to be imported",
      body: "Projects to be imported: MavenSync, MavenDependencies. Maven project structure has been changed. Import changes to IntelliJ IDEA project to make it work correctly. Otherwise, code analysis, completion and other features might work incorrectly.",
      actions: (
        <>
          <BalloonActionLink>Import changes</BalloonActionLink>
          <BalloonActionLink>Enable auto-import</BalloonActionLink>
        </>
      ),
    });
  };
  return <Button onPress={showNotification}>Show balloon notification</Button>;
};

render(<App />);
```
