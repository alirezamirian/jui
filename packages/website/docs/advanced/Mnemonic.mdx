# Mnemonic

Implements [mnemonic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonics_(keyboard)>) UX pattern, for actionable components.
[See more](https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/principles/mnemonics/).

:::tip
`MnemonicTrigger` is typically not used directly as it's used internally in components like `Button` and `Checkbox`.
Only use it if implementing the same pattern for a custom component.
:::

### Live example

```jsx live themed
<>
  <MnemonicTrigger
    mnemonic="P"
    onTriggered={() => alert("First!")}
    isDisabled={false}
  >
    Press Alt+P to activate mnemonic
  </MnemonicTrigger>
  <br />
  <MnemonicTrigger
    mnemonic="m"
    onTriggered={() => alert("Second!")}
    isDisabled={false}
  >
    Hold <code>Alt</code> to activate <MnemonicText>mnemonic</MnemonicText>
  </MnemonicTrigger>
</>
```

:::info
Implementation of mnemonic for `Menu` (currently not done) doesn't require `MnemonicTrigger` as it's activated
based on the focus being on the menu, without requiring a separate activation key (`Alt`).
