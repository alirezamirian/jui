 * This is needed for cypress component testing.
 *
 * **NOTE**: Using react-scripts was first tested to avoid maintaining webpack config here, but there was an issue in
 * using importing from .storybook/preview, caused by a webpack plugin added by react-script's webpack config, which
 * requires all imports to be from src.
 *
 * **NOTE**: There are some transitive dependencies used here like style-loader, css-loader and ts-loader. We may need
 * to change this. Also some peer dependencies of @cypress/webpack-dev-server are missing at the moment but are somehow
 * provided, and therefore ignored!
