For example, the CSS language definition\n           * not only defines CSS highlighting for CSS documents, but also needs to define highlighting for CSS embedded\n           * in HTML through `<style>` elements. To do this, it needs to modify `Prism.languages.markup` and add the\n           * appropriate tokens. However, `Prism.languages.markup` is a regular JavaScript object literal, so if you do\n           * this:\n           *\n           * ```js\n           * Prism.languages.markup.style = {\n           *     // token\n           * };\n           * ```\n           *\n           * then the `style` token will be added (and processed) at the end. `insertBefore` allows you to insert tokens\n           * before existing tokens. For the CSS example above, you would use it like this:\n           *\n           * ```js\n           * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'cdata', {\n           *     'style': {\n           *         // token\n           *     }\n           * });\n           * ```\n           *\n           * ## Special cases\n           *\n           * If the grammars of `inside` and `insert` have tokens with the same name, the tokens in `inside`'s grammar\n           * will be ignored.\n           *\n           * This behavior can be used to insert tokens after `before`:\n           *\n           * ```js\n           * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', {\n           *     'comment': Prism.languages.markup.comment,\n           *     // tokens after 'comment'\n           * });\n           * ```\n           *\n           * ## Limitations\n           *\n           * The main problem `insertBefore` has to solve is iteration order. Since ES2015, the iteration order for object\n           * properties is guaranteed to be the insertion order (except for integer keys) but some browsers behave\n           * differently when keys are deleted and re-inserted. So `insertBefore` can't be implemented by temporarily\n           * deleting properties which is necessary to insert at arbitrary positions.\n           *\n           * To solve this problem, `insertBefore` doesn't actually insert the given tokens into the target object.\n           * Instead, it will create a new object and replace all references to the target object with the new one. This\n           * can be done without temporarily deleting properties, so the iteration order is well-defined.\n           *\n           * However, only references that can be reached from `Prism.languages` or `insert` will be replaced.
