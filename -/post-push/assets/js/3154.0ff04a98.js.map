Different UI components such as Editor,\n * ProjectView or ChangesView set this context when they get focused. The context can then be used in different actions\n * that operate on files/folders.\n * While this allows for contextual actions, without any specific support for \"Action Data\" from the action system,\n * it has some drawbacks, because of which it may make sense to add support for Action Data:\n * - When an action is not triggered by a shortcut, but by clicking an action button, the focused element doesn't\n *   matter. For example, if the editor is focused and \"Rollback\" action is triggered via the shortcut, then the active\n *   path in the editor defines the initially included changes, in the Rollback window. But if the action is triggered\n *   by clicking the rollback button, while the editor is focused, the editor is ignored, and the initially included\n *   changes are set based on selected nodes in ChangesView (which is the default source for initially included changes).\n *   Whether that behaviour is a good thing or not, in order to follow it, having support for Action Data, will help\n *   implementing this behavior, since the action data will be set based on the context, only when the action is\n *   triggered via shortcut.\n *   UPDATE: that's fixed now by introducing the optional `event` argument passed to actionPerformed, which gives us a\n *   chance to know if the action was performed by a shortcut or by clicking an action button.\n * - Action data would allow for lazy evaluation of the required data, only when the action is triggered via a shortcut,\n *   and based on the dom element from which the event is triggered. While in the current approach, the data is\n *   unnecessarily updated as it changes and the data-holder component is focused.\n * - It involves focus/blur event handling to keep track of the current value, for any such focus-based contextual\n *   value. Support for associating event data with elements would not need focus/blur event handling.\n *\n *  @see useActivePathsProvider\n */\nexport const activePathsAtom = atom<string[]>([]);\n\nexport const activePathExistsAtom = atom(\n  (get) => get(activePathsAtom).length > 0\n);\n\n/**\n * Sets the value of {@link activePathsAtom} when focused.\n * @returns focus/blur handling props, to be applied on the container which should set the active path state\n */\nexport const useActivePathsProvider = createFocusBasedSetterHook(\n  activePathsAtom,\n  []\n);\n\n/**\n * Ref to the popup manager of the current project.\n * TODO(multi-project): either:\n *  - introduce project-level store provider, to keep such states per project.\n *  - maybe better, add a feature to the action system, where ActionProvider can define additional contextual properties\n *    to be made available in `context` when calling `actionPerformed` method.

For example calling editorStateManager.focus() may do nothing if the editor is unmounted due\n                 * to filePath being changed. focusing editor in createFile action is an example of such case. It also affects\n                 * certain focus management code within the FileEditor. For example, focusing the editor on tab changes will\n                 * be necessary if the editor remounts with each file change. Or autofocus behavior of the editor can be\n                 * done on the onMount callback of the Editor component, if it's only mounted once. But the same code leads\n                 * to focus issues if the editor is mounted on active tab changes, when they are not done via the tab UI,\n                 * but as a side effect of another action like opening a file via Project tool window.\n                 *\n                 */\n                <Editor\n                  height=\"100%\"\n                  path={filePath}\n                  options={{ contextmenu: false }}\n                  onMount={(monacoEditor, monaco) => {\n                    monacoEditor.focus();\n                    monacoEditor.onContextMenu((c) => {\n                      c.event.preventDefault();\n                      // opening contextmenu async, because otherwise the editor takes the focus back\n                      // from the menu, right after it's opened.\n                      Promise.resolve().then(() => {\n                        setContextMenu(c);\n                      });\n                    });\n                    monacoEditor.onDidScrollChange(() => {\n                      // It doesn't seem easy to disable scroll on Monaco editor, so just closing the context menu on\n                      // scroll, just like the default Monaco context menu.\n                      setContextMenu(null);\n                    });\n                    enableJsx(monaco);\n                    editorRef.current = monacoEditor;\n                    monacoEditor.onDidChangeCursorPosition((e) => {\n                      setCursorPositionState(e.position);\n                    });\n                    monacoEditor.onDidChangeModel(() => {\n                      // TODO: set the editor tab state, and add an atom effect to persist whole editor state across loads\n                    });\n                  }}\n                  onChange={updateContent}\n                  value={content ??

It works by replaying certain keyboard events on the collection container and focused\n * item. An alternative approach (which is used in react-aria's useCombobox) is to use useSelectableCollection\n * separately for the input, but the biggest issue with that approach is that it's limiting in the following ways:\n * - Rendering input should be a part of the same component that renders the collection. Having specific components\n *   for use cases that require a search input is not flexible enough. For example, one may want to use SpeedSearchList\n *   or List connected to an input. Also, the input and the collection may need to be in different layouts in different\n *   use cases. Decoupling the rendering of the input and collection is a more flexible solution.\n * - The same options used for collection should be passed to the input field for behavior consistency, and that is\n *   prone to error.\n *   Some of these options, like `keyboardDelegate` can even have a default value in hooks like\n *   `useSelectableList`.\n *   It means making sure the same value is passed to the useSelectableCollection for input\n *   would require not using the default value, since the same value can't be accessed.\n *\n * With this event-forwarding approach, it's an arrow up or down event would behave exactly like it was triggered on\n * the collection itself, leaving no room for behavior discrepancies. But it has a few drawbacks:\n * - Although small, there is still some coupling between this code and implementation of the collection component.\n *   More specifically, this implementation assumes the following things:\n *   - \"Enter\" keys (selection or action) are handled on items, but arrow keys are handled on the collection element.\n *   - \"[data-key] attribute is set on items. That is used to find the element for the focused item (which, of course,\n *     is not actually focused while the input is).\n *\n * Note: there has been some addition to react-aria useSelectableCollection and useSelectableItem hooks\n * based on CustomEvent and a similar event reply mechanism in useAutocomplete.\n * It may be possible to replace this hook with built-in functionality in react-aria at some point.\n * But at the moment, it seems like that implementation is too coupled with the autocompletion use case, while\n * what is supported here is more generic and allows for the connected search input use case too.\n */\n\nexport const useCollectionFocusProxy = <T>({\n  state,\n  focusProxyRef,\n  collectionRef,\n  onAction,\n}: {\n  focusProxyRef: RefObject<HTMLElement> | undefined;\n  collectionRef: RefObject<HTMLElement>;\n  state: {\n    /** A collection of items in the list. */\n    collection: Collection<Node<T>>;\n    /** A selection manager to read and update multiple selection state. */\n    selectionManager: SelectionManager;\n  };\n  onAction: ((key: Key) => void) | undefined;\n}) => {\n  // TODO: focus/blur events should probably be handled as well, to keep the\n  //  isFocused state of the collection in sync.\n  useEffect(\n    () => {\n      const proxy = focusProxyRef?.current;\n      if (proxy) {\n        const onKeyDown = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {\n          if (event.key === \"ArrowUp\" || event.key === \"ArrowDown\") {\n            event.preventDefault();\n            event.stopPropagation();\n\n            collectionRef.current?.dispatchEvent(\n              new KeyboardEvent(event.type, event)\n            );\n          } else if (\n            event.key === \"Enter\" &&\n            state.selectionManager?.focusedKey != null\n          ) {\n            event.preventDefault(); // in forms, pressing Enter on input submits the form\n            (event.currentTarget as HTMLElement)?.addEventListener(\n              \"keyup\",\n              (event: KeyboardEvent) => {\n                console.log(\n                  \"Keyup\",\n                  event.key,\n                  state.selectionManager.focusedKey,\n                  \"onAction\",\n                  onAction\n                );\n                if (\n                  event.key === \"Enter\" &&\n                  state.selectionManager.focusedKey != null\n                ) {\n                  onAction?.(state.selectionManager.focusedKey);\n                }\n              },\n              { once: true, capture: true }\n            );\n          }\n        };\n        proxy.addEventListener(\"keydown\", onKeyDown);\n        return () => {\n          proxy.removeEventListener(\"keydown\", onKeyDown);\n        };\n      }\n    } /* with no dependency here, event listeners are reattached on each render, but that's the case when unmemoized\n    event handlers are passed to elements too (e.g., when using any react-aria hook) */\n  );\n};\n","import React, {\n  CSSProperties,\n  ForwardedRef,\n  forwardRef,\n  HTMLProps,\n  Ref,\n  useRef,\n} from \"react\";\nimport { mergeProps, useObjectRef } from \"@react-aria/utils\";\nimport { AriaComboBoxProps, useComboBox } from \"@react-aria/combobox\";\nimport { useComboBoxState } from \"@react-stately/combobox\";\nimport { styled } from \"@intellij-platform/core/styled\";\nimport { UnknownThemeProp } from \"@intellij-platform/core/Theme\";\nimport { ControlledStateProps } from \"@intellij-platform/core/type-utils\";\nimport { BareButton } from \"@intellij-platform/core/Button\";\nimport { Popover } from \"@intellij-platform/core/Overlay\";\nimport { StatelessListBox } from \"./StatelessListBox\";\nimport { StyledContainer } from \"./StyledContainer\";\nimport { LabelPlacement, WithLabel } from \"../Field/Label\";\nimport { StyledDropdownArrowIcon } from \"./StyledDropdownArrowIcon\";\nimport {\n  PositionedTooltipTrigger,\n  ValidationTooltip,\n} from \"@intellij-platform/core/Tooltip\";\nimport {\n  ContextHelpProps,\n  WithInlineContextHelp,\n} from \"@intellij-platform/core/Field/ContextHelp\";\n\ntype AriaProps<T> = {\n  [K in keyof T as K extends `aria-${string}` ?

Other components can also similarly be\n * rendered inside toolbar without adopting any specific API. It's worth noting that any generic approach based\n * on children react nodes instead of children DOM nodes will have many edge cases and will involve assumptions\n * that will limit the API of toolbar. Also, any approach based on moving dom nodes to the overflow popup will\n * conflict with React owning the DOM.\n *\n * #### Assumption\n *\n * Since the overflow popup renders the same `children`, and items in the toolbar and popup overflow are made\n * visible/hidden based on the index of DOM nodes, it's important than children deterministically results in the\n * same dom structure. i.e. if a component in children randomly renders different number of root dom nodes in\n * each render, it can cause issues in hiding/showing elements.\n *\n * ### Orientation\n * A few reasons for not having separate `HorizontalToolbar` and `VerticalToolbar` components instead of `Toolbar` with\n * `orientation` prop:\n * - From usage side, a single `Toolbar` component is considered a more discoverable API.\n * - Separate components would require abstracting common parts which unnecessarily adds to complexity.\n *   The amount of branching to handle the differences is considered ok, at the current state of the component.\n */\n\n/**\n * @description\n * A toolbar is a container for {@link IconButton} and similar UI components.\n *\n * ## Features:\n * - A toolbar can be horizontal or vertical\n * - When there is not enough space for all children, toolbar shows an arrow icon, which shows the overflowing\n *   items in a popup, upon mouseover.\n *   Optionally, overflow can be wrapped into multiple lines, in horizontal toolbars.\n *\n * @example\n * <Toolbar>\n *   <IconButton aria-label=\"Show Diff\">\n *     <PlatformIcon icon=\"actions/diff\" />\n *   </IconButton>\n *   </Toolbar>\n */\nexport const Toolbar: React.FC<ToolbarProps> = ({\n  border,\n  orientation = \"horizontal\",\n  ...props\n}): React.ReactElement => {\n  const overflowBehavior =\n    orientation === \"horizontal\" && \"overflowBehavior\" in props\n      ? props.overflowBehavior\n      : null;\n  const rootProps = { style: props.style, className: props.className };\n  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);\n  const overlayRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);\n  const showMoreButtonRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null);\n  const StyledToolbar =\n    orientation === \"horizontal\"\n      ?
